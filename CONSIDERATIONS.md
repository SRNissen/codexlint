# CONSIDERATIONS

A history of the considerations and trade-offs for this project.

As a history, remember that anything mentioned in this document was relevant at the time of writing, not necessarily at the time of reading.

## Testing 

### 2024-06-13T15:22:00Z

1) Test intent over implementation details
- Tests should verify user-visible/desired behavior.
- Avoid assertions that depend on transient/internal states unless that state is part of the requirement.

2) Generated test artifacts vs checked-in fixtures
- Runtime generation of tiny analyzer scripts/counters is acceptable here.
- Benefits:
  - Better test isolation and cleanup per run.
  - Less fixture sprawl for one-off scripts.
  - Runtime-safe path construction.
- Tradeoff acknowledged: static fixtures can be easier to inspect.

3) Integration invocation budget
- Keep full linter invocations low to improve reliability and runtime.
- Consolidate behavior checks where practical.
- Current target direction: one integration linter invocation for save-triggered behavior + cooldown, and move pure parsing checks out of linter-invoking path.

4) Timeouts and wait behavior
- Fixed short waits (for example 5 seconds) are too brittle for this project.
- Default polling wait should be tied to linter timeout:
  - waitFor default = codexlint.operation.timeoutMs + 5000 ms

5) Failure interpretation guidance
- A timeout in waitFor means expected state was not observed in time; it does not automatically mean analyzer timeout.
- Distinguish:
  - Harness/setup/network failures (e.g. npm audit)
  - Analyzer execution failures
  - Diagnostic state race conditions

6) Diagnostic assertions
- Prefer filtering by source == "codexlint" to avoid interference from other diagnostics.
- For asynchronous flows, wait for semantic terminal conditions, not only diagnostic counts.

7) Non-JSON parser behavior
- parseJsonLenient behavior is a pure/unit concern and does not require full linter invocation.
- Keep parser fallback expectations covered without spending integration invocation budget.

8) Environment notes observed
- VS Code test harness currently launches with --disable-extensions by design.
- Seeing "all extensions disabled" in that harness is expected behavior, not itself a regression.

9) Test coverage map and next priorities

Covered behavior (high confidence):
- Extension activates in VS Code host.
- Save-triggered analysis produces codexlint diagnostics.
- Cooldown gate suppresses immediate rerun.
- parseJsonLenient handles direct JSON, fenced JSON, embedded JSON, non-JSON, and empty output.

Not directly covered yet (with reason):
- `src/debug.ts#printEnv` and debug command visibility toggling:
  - Reason: not yet covered; user-facing debug behavior.
- `src/shared.ts#getConfig` branch coverage (preset selection, prompt toggles, selected skill parsing edges):
  - Reason: not yet covered; behavioral config interpretation.
- `src/shared.ts#runProcessWithTimeout` failure branches (spawn error, non-zero exit, timeout):
  - Reason: not yet covered; behavioral reliability path.
- `src/saveCoordinator.ts#shouldAnalyzeDocument` branch coverage (non-file, empty, too large, binary, skipBinaryFiles=false):
  - Reason: not yet covered; behavioral gating rules.
- `src/saveCoordinator.ts` analysis failure diagnostic path (`analysis-command-failed`):
  - Reason: not yet covered; behavioral error handling.
- `src/saveCoordinator.ts` debug IO logging branch:
  - Reason: not yet covered; optional but behaviorally meaningful.
- `src/saveCoordinator.ts` stale-run suppression via sequence map:
  - Reason: not yet covered; behavioral concurrency guard.
- `src/saveCoordinator.ts#toRange` edge clamping behavior:
  - Reason: partly covered indirectly, edge behavior not explicit.
- `src/analyze.ts` normalization/severity mapping edge cases:
  - Reason: mostly not yet covered; parser and mapping behavior.
- `src/analyze.ts` unexpected schema rejection path:
  - Reason: not yet covered; parse guard behavior.
- `src/extension.ts` resource disposal and no-op deactivate:
  - Reason: mostly incidental lifecycle plumbing; low direct user-visible behavior.
- `test/unit/hello.unit.test.mjs`:
  - Reason: placeholder, not product behavior.

Prioritized next-test sequence (correctness first, low flake):
1. Unit tests for `getConfig` branch behavior (`src/shared.ts`).
2. Unit tests for `runProcessWithTimeout` failure/success paths with tiny local helper scripts.
3. Integration tests for `shouldAnalyzeDocument` gating rules (non-file/empty/oversized/binary).
4. Integration test for `analysis-command-failed` diagnostic on analyzer failure.
5. Unit tests for normalize/mapping behavior from `src/analyze.ts` (severity, defaults, invalid finding filtering).
6. Integration tests for stale-run suppression and range-clamping edges.
7. Debug command tests (`printEnv` and visibility context), if still considered worth the runtime cost.
8. Remove or replace `hello.unit.test.mjs` with behavioral tests only.
